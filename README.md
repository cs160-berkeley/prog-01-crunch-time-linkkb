# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Crunch Time is an excersize conversion app - for a given exercise and workout intensity, it will tell you the number of calories burned and and equivalent workouts for different types of exercise.

The APK located in /app/build/output/apk is the basic app without any of the extra credit features. The apk in the EC build folder doesn't correspond to the source code provided, but all its mechanisms are copy-pastes of the same functions in the base build. The added functionality includes the extra exercises and the ability to convert from calories. No visual iconography, orientation accommodations, or weight modifiers were applied.
